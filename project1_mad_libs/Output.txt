Once upon a time, there was a yellow tree who loved to go swimming all day.

One day, horse walked into the room and caught the tree in the act.

horse: "What are you doing?"
tree: "I'm just go swimminging, what's the big deal?"
horse: Well, it's not every day that you see a tree go swimminging in the middle of the day."
tree: "I guess you're right. Maybe I should take a break."
horse: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go sleep instead?"

And so, horse and the tree went off to sleep and had a great time.
The end.
